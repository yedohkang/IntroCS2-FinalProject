	<h3> Madeline Wong & Yedoh Kang (Pd6)</h3> </center>


<h2> Description </h2>
<p> Our website will help indecisive high school students determine their top potential major and corresponding college by taking a quiz and a questionnaire. They will also be able to create an account so that they can login to retake their major quiz or re-enter their new information and get their updated results if their interests or information change. However, we cannot guarantee that they will get in to that college or pursue that specific major in real life, as there was only a select number of colleges and majors. </p>

<h2> Personnel </h2>

<h3> Programming </h3>
<ul>
	<li> the login/account system was greatly aided by the code we did in class (Mr. Holmes, Pd6). Including Kenny Chen's html python code. </li>
	<li> said above as well, our csvToDict.py code came from Haley </li>
</ul>

<h3> Data sources </h3>
<p> We didn't necessarily use data sources that others collected because we made up all the information because of time constraints, but here are the links to the different colleges:</p>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/"> Harvard University </a> </li>
	<li> <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/"> New York University </a> </li>

<h2> Achievements </h2>
<ol>
	<li> Created the welcome page </li>
	<li> Created the login page for new and existing users (HTML + Python) </li>
	<li> Created the page that welcomes the user and leads to the major quiz </li>
	<li> Created the major quiz (HTML + Python) </li>
	<li> Created the major results page where it displays your major result and a link to fill out the corresponding questionnaire </li>
	<li> Created different questionnaires for each major (HTML + Python) </li>
	<li> Created the college results page where it displays your college result and a link to the college's website </li>
</ol>

<h3> Features of note </h3>
<ul> 
	<li> Our HTML/CSS!! We (mainly Yedoh) worked really hard on that and learned a lot of new stuff so that our project would look presentable! </li>
</ul>
<ul> 
	<li> We made sure that someone always ended up having a major, even if they didnt choose majority answer choices by giving them the first greatest chosen major. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Learning </h3>
<p> The only new thing we learned and used was CSS, from W3Schools. </p>

<h2> Next Steps, with time estimates </h2>
<ul> 
	<li> find a way to correspond major + college result to the account, so that when they register back in, they can access their info without retaking the quiz again </li>
</ul>

<h2> Finished Steps, identified by worker </h2>
<ul>
	<li> login system (python): Maddie </li>
	<li> welcome page (html): Yedoh </li>
	<li> login page (html): Yedoh </li>
	<li> login to major quiz page (python + html): Yedoh & Maddie </li>
	<li> major quiz (html): Yedoh </li>
	<li> major quiz (python): Yedoh & Maddie </li>
	<li> college quizzes (html): Yedoh </li>
	<li> college quizzes (python): Yedoh </li>
	<li> final results page with both major and college: Yedoh & Maddie </li>
	<li> finishing touches/debugging: Maddie & Yedoh </li>
</ul>

<h2> Bugs </h2>
<p> The major bug we have is that we couldn't (didn't have time) correspond the results of both the major and the college to the user's account info, so that when they login again, they couldn't see their previous results.
    Also we get key errors only when the link is sent through snapchat, which is very interesting. Maybe our codes get all scrambled up. </p>
